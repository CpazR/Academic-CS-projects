CS315 Project 1: Trains
Written in Java by Nicholas Reel
Makefile based on template provided by Raphael Finkel

Concept:
Given user input, of number of trains, cars, and steps, shuffle train cars around.

Trains are illustrated as linked lists
Cars are illustrated as nodes in a given list.
The size of the cars are the values of these nodes.

The size of the cars must be organized as such from front to rear: 1 ... # of cars.

This is illustrated as more valuable cargo is packed in the rear cars.

Cars will be removed from either the front or rear of the train.

This will update the values of the trains, which is the sum of each cars position times their size (value).
This will repeat for n steps, or until any of the trains are empty.
