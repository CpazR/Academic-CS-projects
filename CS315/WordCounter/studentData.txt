 Pen-Pen is a penguin. He(?) likes fish. At least, we think so. He's a rambunctious fellow. He's fed every morning and downs the fish we put in his bowl.
Before we start our day, he uses the bathroom. Perhaps he simply doing his "business," but we always end up hearing the shower run.

Next thing we know, he has towel wrapped around him once he's finished in the there.

Don't be like Pen Pen, wait to use the shower if you're a penguin that only lazies around all day.

That, or have the decency to shower early in the morning. Some of us have school/work to go to.....
