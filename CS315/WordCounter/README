CS315 Project 4: Word Counter
Written in Java by Nicholas Reel
Makefile based on template provided by Raphael Finkel

Overview:
Given an piped input of strings, the program will store each instance of a word in a hashtable. With recurring instances being listed as a "duplicates" counter for each node.
When hashing words might occasionally collide in the table. In the event this happens, adjacent indices are checked to see if they are populated, if not, they are used instead.

When printed, given sorting criteria (ASCII alphabetical or duplicates) it will sort, print each of the sorted notes one at a time, then discard the sorted array.

The result is an alphabetically sorted list starting with capital (A-Z) words, followed by lowercase (a-z) words. Then a list sorted by occurrences starting from most occurred.
